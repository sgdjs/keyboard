This repository contain my own changes to the French Dvorak keyboard,
named BÃ©po, maintained by Ergodis, find on http://bepo.fr

* Optimo: optimized layout for Orthogonal keyboards
* Optima: optimized layout with A fingers position, for staggered keyboards

The bepo.fr branch is set to track https://git.tuxfamily.org/dvorak/pilotes.git

Instructions pour utiliser l'outil (in French only that I know of): http://bepo.fr/wiki/ConfigGenerator
