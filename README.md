# Optimo Keyboard Layout

The French AZERTY keyboard being an absurd design (typing È or Ç is
impossible), the community ended up creating the  layout.

The Optimo layout is a fork of the [bepo](bepo.fr) keyboard layout with:

* Better availability of W and Z
* Direct access to ´ (dead acute), better access to \` (dead grave)
* Direct or improved access to developer’s characters: <, >, \_, \,
  no shift insecable space

## [Optimo](optimo): optimized layout for Orthogonal keyboards
## [Optima](optima): optimized layout with A fingers position, for staggered ISO keyboards

The bepo.fr branch is set to track https://git.tuxfamily.org/dvorak/pilotes.git
