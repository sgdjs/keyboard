This repository contain my own changes to the French Dvorak keyboard,
named BÃ©po, maintained by Ergodis, find on http://bepo.fr

* The master branch pulls from https://git.tuxfamily.org/dvorak/pilotes.git
* My development branch is sgdjs. I add my changes to the main repo here
* The layout folder contains the branches for development of different
  variations of the desired keyboard

Instructions pour utiliser l'outil (in French only that I know of): http://bepo.fr/wiki/ConfigGenerator
