* The kb folder contains the branches for development of different
  variations of the desired keyboard

# Variations

## Optimo

Optimo stands for Optimized and Ortholinear. It is meant to be used on
an ortholinear keyboard, as important characters are set on è/T ^/Y K/B.

## Optimo-staggered

The staggered version of the Optimo is adapted to regular staggered
keyboards.
