# Optimo Keyboard Layout

The Optimo layout is a fork of the [bepo](http://bepo.fr) layout adapted
to the reduced format (40%) of the Planck Keyboard:

* New position of M, W and Z
* Direct access to ´ (dead acute), better access to \` (dead grave)

* Developer oriented changes:
  * < and > in direct access, reversed with « and »
  * \ { } \_ and \[EFI\] (Narrow No-Break SPace) on liberated positions.

## Planck
