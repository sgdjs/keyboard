# Optimo 40%

The optimo layout for 40% orthogonal keyboards such as the Planck could
be used with the optimo layout. 

## Optimo 40% Default

The default firmware does not have AltGr and the Raise-Down layer does not make use of the home row. At first it might be possible to use it as is with the Ctrl+Alt, but it might turn too hard to use (see below).

## Optimo 40%

As long as the keyboard has to be programmed to put AltGr, some
ergonomic changes will be made:

* symetric Shift
* number keys on the home row (with Raise-Down buttons)
* remap of M
